The current implementation of OpenSpaces uses a very old version of [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org/ "OpenLayers"): so old that most of the awesome cool mobile stuff isn't present. To rectify this, I've posted a load of sample code to a [GitHub](https://github.com/devork/openspaces) project that shows how to use OpenLayers with Ordnance Survey OpenSpaces.

<!-- more -->

What's in the bundle? 

```tools``` : set of scripts to get the latest Openlayers, Proj4 and the dark OL theme  
```src``` : the demo code - simple HTML app that displays a map.

Have fun and let me now if you get any probs/find it useful etc.
